/** Marks a method that is going to be notified when a 
 * property defined by {@link Model} has been changed. This is
 * especially useful when one wants to react to changes in the 
 * model caused by the rendered view. In case of 
 * <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">knockout.js</a> technology
 * one could for example react to selection of a name from a combo
 * box:
 * <pre>
 * 
 * &lt;!-- associates the selected value with property <em>name</em> --&gt;
 * 
 * &lt;select data-bind="value: name"&gt;
 *   &lt;option&gt;Jiří&lt;/option&gt;
 *   &lt;option&gt;Jarda&lt;/option&gt;
 *   &lt;option&gt;Petr&lt;/option&gt;
 *   &lt;option&gt;Tomáš&lt;/option&gt;
 * &lt;/select&gt;
 * 
 * // Java code snippet reacting to change of the <em>name</em> property:
 * 
 * {@link OnPropertyChange @OnPropertyChange}("name") 
 * <b>static void</b> propertyChanged(AModel inst, {@link String} propertyName) {
 *   // schedule some operation
 *   // on the model
 * }
 * </pre>
 * The method's first argument should be the instance of the 
 * associated {@link Model model class}. The method shall be non-private
 * and unless {@link Model#instance() instance mode} is on also static.
 * There can be an optional second {@link String} argument which will be set
 * to the name of the changed property. The second argument is only useful when
 * a single method reacts to changes in multiple properties.
 * <p>
 * An online example using this technique is 
 * <a target="_blank" href="http://dew.apidesign.org/dew/#7138581">available here</a> -
 * it observes selection in a combo box and in case it changes 
 * the example sends a network
 * request and {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive asynchronously updates}
 * list of code snippets.
