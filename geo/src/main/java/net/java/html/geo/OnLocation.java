/** Generates a handle which can configure, {@link Position.Handle#start() start}
 * and {@link Position.Handle#stop() stop} requests for obtaining current
 * location of the application/device/user. Put the {@link OnLocation} annotation
 * on top of a (non-private) method in your class which takes one argument
 * {@link Position}. Based on name of your method (unless a class name is
 * directly specified via {@link #className()} attribute) a handle class is
 * generated. For example if your method name is <code>callMeWhenYouKnowWhereYouAre</code>
 * a package private class <code>CallMeWhenYouKnowWhereYouAreHandle</code> will
 * be generated in the same package. One can use its <code>createQuery</code>
 * and <code>createWatch</code> static method to get one time/repeated time
 * instance of a {@link Position.Handle handle}. After configuring the
 * {@link Position.Handle handle} via its setter methods, one can 
 * {@link Position.Handle#start() start} the location request.
 * <p>
 * In case something goes wrong a method in the same class named {@link #onError()}
 * can be specified (should take one {@link Exception} parameter).
