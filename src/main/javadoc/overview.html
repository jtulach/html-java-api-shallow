        <p>
         Use Java to write application logic; Use HTML5 to render the UI;
         {@link net.java.html.json.Model Animate an HTML page from Java}
         (see <a target="_blank" href="http://dew.apidesign.org/dew/#7212206">Duke being rotated</a> by CSS);
         Use {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive REST} or
         <a href="net/java/html/json/doc-files/websockets.html">WebSockets</a>;
         interact with <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html">JavaScript</a>;
         Get the best of both worlds!

         The goal of these APIs is to use full featured Java runtime
         (like real <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HotSpot">HotSpot VM</a>),
         but still rely on a very lightweight rendering technology
         (so it can potentially fit
         <a target="_blank" href="http://bck2brwsr.apidesign.org">Bck2Brwsr</a> and definitely
         to various types of phones). What can be more lightweight
         (from a browser perspective) than
         <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>!?
         By default we use {@link net.java.html.boot.fx JavaFX's WebView}
         component to display the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>.
         We eliminate the need to manipulate the DOM directly,
         there is a special {@link net.java.html.json Java to Knockout.js binding}.
         As a result the <a target="_blank" href="http://knockoutjs.com">HTML uses Knockout.js syntax</a>,
         yet the application code can be written in Java.
        </p>

        <h3>New features in version 1.4</h3>

        Both values <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are
        <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html#undefined">treated as null</a>.
        Better behavior under <a target="_blank" href="https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=259132">
        multi-threaded load</a>.
        Integration with <a href="net/java/html/boot/truffle/package-summary.html">Truffle</a>.

        <h3>Improvements in version 1.3</h3>

        {@link net.java.html.json.Model Model classes} can have 
        {@link net.java.html.json.Model#instance() per-instance private data}.
        {@link net.java.html.json.Model Model classes} can generate
        builder-like construction methods if builder
        {@link net.java.html.json.Model#builder() prefix} is specified.
        {@link net.java.html.json.Property#mutable} can be <code>false</code>
        to define a non-mutable (almost constant) property. That
        in case of <em>Knockout</em> bindings means: the property is
        represented by a plain value rather than an observable in the JavaScript
        object. The <em>JavaFX</em> presenter can be executed in headless mode -
        just specify <code>-Dfxpresenter.headless=true</code> when launching
        its virtual machine and no window will be shown. This is particularly
        useful for testing. Configure your <em>surefire</em> or <em>failsafe</em>
        plugins like: <pre>
&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.13&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;configuration&gt;
      &lt;systemPropertyVariables&gt;
          &lt;fxpresenter.headless&gt;true&lt;/fxpresenter.headless&gt;
      &lt;/systemPropertyVariables&gt;
  &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
        OSGi headers are now <a target="_blank" href="https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=256696">
            enterprise OSGi ready</a>.
        Switched to <a target="_blank" href="https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=257130">minified version 3.4.0</a>
        of <a target="_blank" href="http://knockoutjs.com">knockout.js</a>.
        Better support for <a target="_blank" href="https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=257348">
        recursive @Model definitions</a>.
        New module <code>org.netbeans.html:xhr4j</code> provides implementation
        of {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.Transfer} with
        {@link org.netbeans.html.context.spi.Contexts.Id technology identifier}
        <b>xhr4j</b> - this module can be used to
        <a target="_blank" href='https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=257849'>workaround limitations
        of CORS</a> by handling the {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive}
        connections in Java.

        <h3>What's Been Improved in Version 1.2.3?</h3>

        One can control {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive#headers() HTTP request headers}
        when connecting to server using the {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive}
        annotation. It is possible to have
        {@link net.java.html.json.ComputedProperty#write() writable computed properties}.
        There is an easy way to enable <a target="_blank" href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> in
        the JavaFX based Web View -
        just run with <code>-Dfirebug.lite=true</code> as
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rxwY-QJiLo">this video</a>
        demonstrates.
        Bugfix of issues <a target="_blank" href='https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=250503'>250503</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href='https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=252987'>252987</a>.

        <h3>What's New in Version 1.1?</h3>

        <p>
            The content of a {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx context}
            can be selected by registering implementations under specific
            {@link org.netbeans.html.context.spi.Contexts.Id technology identifiers}
            and requesting them during
            {@link org.netbeans.html.context.spi.Contexts#newBuilder(java.lang.Object...) construction}
            of the context. <code>org.netbeans.html:ko4j</code> module's implementation
            offers <b>ko4j</b>, <b>xhr</b> and <b>websocket</b> identifiers
            for its registered services
            (e.g. {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.Technology},
            {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.Transfer} and
            {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.WSTransfer}).
            <code>org.netbeans.html:ko-ws-tyrus</code>
            module registers its
            {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.Transfer Java based JSON} and
            {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.WSTransfer WebSocket} implementations
            under the name <b>tyrus</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A particular DOM subtree
            that a <a target="_blank" href="http://knockoutjs.com">knockout.js</a> model gets
            applied to can be selected by using
            {@link net.java.html.json.Models#applyBindings(java.lang.Object,java.lang.String)
            Models.applyBindings(m, id)} with an id of an HTML element.
            There is new {@link net.java.html.json.Model#targetId()} attribute
            which controls behavior of the generated <code>applyBindings</code> method.
            If <em>specified and non-empty</em>, then the generated method
            will call {@link net.java.html.json.Models#applyBindings(java.lang.Object,java.lang.String)}
            with <code>this</code> and the provided {@link net.java.html.json.Model#targetId() target id}.
            If <em>specified, but left empty</em>, then the generated method
            calls {@link net.java.html.json.Models#applyBindings(java.lang.Object)}.
            <em>If unspecified</em>, the method will <b>not</b> be generated at all
            (a change with respect to older versions). However one can
            still use {@link net.java.html.json.Models#applyBindings(java.lang.Object)}
            or {@link net.java.html.json.Models#applyBindings(java.lang.Object,java.lang.String)}
            to perform the association of any model with the page element.
        </p>
        <p>
            Memory model when using Knockout bindings has been improved
            (required additions of two new methods:
            {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.PropertyBinding#weak()} and
            {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.FunctionBinding#weak()}) and
            now the Java {@link net.java.html.json.Model models} can garbage collect,
            when no longer used. Library writers that use
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotation can also
            control garbage collection behavior of method arguments by
            setting {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody#keepAlive() keepAlive=false}
            attribute.
        </p>

        <h3>What's New in Version 1.0?</h3>

        <p>
            {@link net.java.html.json.Property#array() Array properties} are now
            mutable from the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">knockout.js</a>
            point of view (required {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi.Proto.Type#replaceValue one SPI change}).
            The page lookup mechanism can use {@link net.java.html.boot.BrowserBuilder#locale(java.util.Locale) locale}
            to load localized a page with appropriate suffix.
            All SPI were moved under the NetBeans namespace - e.g.
            {@link org.netbeans.html.boot.spi},
            {@link org.netbeans.html.context.spi},
            {@link org.netbeans.html.json.spi},
            {@link org.netbeans.html.sound.spi}, and also
            {@link org.netbeans.html.json.tck}. Methods annotated
            with {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotation and
            without fallback Java code now throw {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}
            with a message suggesting to switch to proper
            {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx#execute browser context} to
            prevent endless debugging when one forgets to do so.

            }
            showHistoric(false);
            </script>

        <h3>What's New in Version 0.9?</h3>

        <p>
            System can run in {@link net.java.html.boot.BrowserBuilder#classloader(java.lang.ClassLoader) Felix OSGi container} (originally only Equinox).
            {@link net.java.html.json.ComputedProperty Derived properties}
            now deeply check changes in other {@link net.java.html.json.Model model
            classes} they depend on and recompute their values accordingly.
            <a target="_blank" href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout.js</a> library has been updated
            to version 3.2.0.
        </p>

        <h3>What's New in 0.8.x Versions?</h3>

        <p>
            Setters or array properties on classes generated by {@link net.java.html.json.Model}
            annotation can be accessed from any thread. {@link org.netbeans.html.sound.spi.AudioEnvironment}
            can be registered into {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx}. There is
            a {@link net.java.html.json.Models#parse(net.java.html.BrwsrCtx, java.lang.Class, java.io.InputStream, java.util.Collection)  method}
            to parse a JSON array and convert it into
            {@link net.java.html.json.Model model classes}.
            Improved behavior of <code>enum</code> values in
            {@link net.java.html.json.Model knockout bindings}.
        </p>

        <p>
            Few bugfixes for better portability.
            New API for {@link net.java.html.boot.script.Scripts headless execution}
            on top of <em>Nashorn</em> - does not run <em>knockout for Java</em>
            fully yet
            (reported as <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8046013">JDK-8046013</a>),
            however even in current state it is quite
            {@link net.java.html.boot.script.Scripts useful for testing}
            of
            {@link net.java.html.js Java/JavaScript interactions}.
        </p>

        <p>
            {@link net.java.html.boot.fx.FXBrowsers} has been extended
            with new helper methods to make it easier to use HTML+Java
            API in existing JavaFX applications.
            The annotation processor is made
            more robust with respect to errors in callback syntax of
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} body parameter.
            Javadoc of {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx#execute} method
            has been improved based on a failure of its usability study.
            There can be additional parameters to methods annotated by
            {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive} that allows one to
            pass state when a JSON call is made and use it when it finishes.
            The mechanism of discovery of sibling HTML page has been
            extended to work on systems that don't support
            {@link java.lang.Class#getProtectionDomain}.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first argument of method annotated by
            {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive} annotation has to
            be the associated {@link net.java.html.json.Model model class}.
        </p>

        <p>
            {@link net.java.html.json.OnReceive} annotation now accepts
            {@link java.util.List} of data values as second argument
            (previously required an array).
        </p>


        <h3>What's New in 0.7.x Versions?</h3>

        <p>
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotation has new attribute
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody#wait4js()} which allows
            asynchronous execution. Libraries using
            {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} are urged to use this
            new attribute as much as possible, as it can speed up execution
            in certain environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx#execute(java.lang.Runnable)} in
            multi-threaded environment to execute your code on the browser thread.
            See example
            {@link net.java.html.BrwsrCtx#execute(java.lang.Runnable) using Java timer}.

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>

        This <b>HTML/Java</b> API is used by
        <a target="_blank" href="https://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-dukescript.html">
        NetBeans Platform</a> as well as other project. The smoothest way
        to get started is to follow the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://dukescript.com/getting_started.html">getting started</a>
        tutorial. In case one wants to stick with a <em>Maven</em> and command
        line, one can follow
        <a target="_blank" href="https://dukescript.com/update/2015/02/05/New-Version-of-Dukescript.html">
            these instructions<a>, make sure at least
        <em>JDK7</em> is your installed Java and type:
        <pre>
$ mvn archetype:generate \
 -DarchetypeGroupId=com.dukescript.archetype \
 -DarchetypeArtifactId=knockout4j-archetype \
 -DarchetypeVersion=0.11 <em># or newer version, if available</em>
        </pre>
        Answer few questions (for example choose <em>myfirstbrwsrpage</em> as artifactId)
        and then you can:
        <pre>
$ cd myfirstbrwsrpage
$ mvn install
$ mvn -f client/pom.xml process-classes exec:exec
        </pre>
        In a few seconds (or minutes if
        <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a>
        decides to download the whole Internet of dependencies) you should
        see a sample Hello World application.
        Immediatelly you can be
        <a target="_blank" href="https://dukescript.com/best/practices/2015/04/12/no-redeploys.html">
        productive without any redeploys</a> - even more productive than
        with plain JavaScript!
        <p>
        The application is rendered in a
        <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/JavaFX">JavaFX</a>
        web view component (that of course requires your JDK to come
        with <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/JavaFX">JavaFX</a>;
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK7
            and JDK8 from Oracle</a> contain everything that is needed).
        The generated application is built around one
        Java source (uses the {@link net.java.html.json.Model} annotation to
        auto-generate another <code>Data.java</code> class during compilation)
        and one HTML file (uses the <a target="_blank" href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a>
        syntax to <code>data-bind</code> the HTML elements to the
        generated <code>Data</code> model):
        <pre>
$ ls client/src/main/java/**/DataModel.java
$ ls client/src/main/webapp/pages/index.html
        </pre>

        <h2>IDE Support</h2>

        <p>
            This API is part of <a target="_blank"
            href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans.org</a> project and as such
            it works naturally with the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://netbeans.org/features/index.html">NetBeans IDE</a>.
            On the other hand, the API is using nothing NetBeans specific,
            it builds on standard Java6 APIs and as such it shall work fine
            in any IDE.
        </p>

        <p>
            A lot of work is done by
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/AnnotationProcessor">
            annotation processors</a>
            that generate various boiler plate code during compilation. This
            is a standard part of Java since JDK6, but for example Eclipse
            is known not to deal with processors well and developers using
            it need to be careful. IntelliJ users hasn't reported any issues
            and of course, NetBeans IDE support for
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/AnnotationProcessor">processors</a>
            is outstanding.
        </p>

        <p>
            When using {@link net.java.html.js.JavaScriptBody} annotation, it is
            useful to do a bit of post processing of classes. There is a
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a>
            plugin for that.
            NetBeans IDE will invoke it when doing a build. Other IDEs may
            need some hint to do so.
            Anyway: If one does not see all (generated) sources or is getting
            {@link java.lang.LinkageError}s when executing the application,
            switch to command line and do clean build
            from there:
        </p>
        <pre>$ mvn clean install</pre>
        <p>
            If that succeeds, your IDE of choice will hopefully
            pick the generated sources up and present the result of the build
            properly. If not,
            <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/">download NetBeans</a>,
            you will be pleasantly
            surprised - for example with our excellent
            <a href="net/java/html/js/package-summary.html#debugging">Java/JavaScript
            debugging</a> support.

        <p>
        It is not goal of this documentation to list all possible ways
        to package and deploy applications which use this API. However it is
        important for new comers to see the benefits of using the
        <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> API and as such
        let's list at least few bundling options, known to work at the time of writing
        this documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
        First of all, this is a <em>client technology</em>. You write client applications
        with it which may, but need not connect to a server. You don't need
        Tomcat or WebLogic to deploy
        <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> applications.
        </p>

            The sample project generated by
            <code>org.apidesign.html knockout4j-archetype</code> is configured
            to use <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/JavaFX">JavaFX</a>
            as the rendering technology. This setup is primarily suitable for
            development - it needs no special packaging, starts quickly and
            allows you to use classical HotSpot VM debuggers. A final
            artifact from the build is also a ZIP file which you can use
            and distribute to your users. Good for desktop applications.

            All the <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> libraries
            are packaged as <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi">OSGi</a>
            bundles and as such they can easily be run in NetBeans as well as
            in Eclipse. As a result one can use
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi">OSGi</a>
            and have a common module system for both platforms. In addition to that
            one can render using
            HTML and have a common UI in both platforms. In such case
            your application would be packaged as a set of
            <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi">OSGi</a> bundles.

            There is more and more attempts to execute Java bytecode
            in a browser, without any special Java plugin installed.
            The <a href="http://html.java.net">HTML for Java</a> is
            carefully designed to produce lightweight, well performing
            applications even on such restricted environments. It uses
            no reflection calls and that allows to statically pre-compile
            the applications into JavaScript. One of such environments
            is called <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/Bck2Brwsr">Bck2Brwsr</a>,
            another <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/TeaVM">TeaVM</a>. Both support the

            can run on any modern browser, we can ask whether they can also
            fit into a phone!? Yes, they can and especially to phones
            that can execute Java code already! Just by changing your
            packaging you can create an APK file and deploy it to your
            Android phone.
